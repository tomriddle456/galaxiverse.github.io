                <p>Uranus is a fascinating and unique planet in our solar system, notable for its unusual tilt, icy composition, and serene appearance. It's the seventh planet from the Sun and classified as an ice giant, along with Neptune. Here’s a detailed
                    overview of Uranus: 1. Size and Structure: Ice Giant: Uranus is the third-largest planet by diameter in the solar system and the fourth-largest by mass. It has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles), which is roughly
                    four times the diameter of Earth. Mass and Gravity: Uranus has a mass that is 14.5 times that of Earth, and its gravity is about 0.89 times that of Earth. This means that if you weighed 100 kg on Earth, you would weigh about 89 kg
                    on Uranus. Composition: Like Neptune, Uranus is an ice giant, which means its interior is composed mostly of heavier elements than hydrogen and helium. Uranus has a rocky core surrounded by a thick mantle of water, ammonia, and methane
                    ices. Atmosphere: Uranus has an atmosphere mainly composed of hydrogen (H₂) and helium (He), with a significant amount of methane (CH₄), which gives the planet its blue-green color. Methane absorbs red light and reflects blue light,
                    leading to this distinct hue. 2. Orbit and Distance: Distance from the Sun: Uranus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 2.87 billion kilometers (1.78 billion miles), or approximately 19.2 Astronomical Units (AU). One AU is
                    the distance between Earth and the Sun. Long Year: It takes Uranus about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. This means that each season on Uranus lasts more than 20 years. Nearly Circular Orbit: Uranus’s orbit is
                    almost circular, meaning it remains at a relatively consistent distance from the Sun throughout its journey. 3. Tilt and Rotation: Extreme Tilt: One of Uranus’s most unusual features is its extreme axial tilt of 97.77 degrees. Unlike
                    other planets, which have tilts that cause moderate seasonal changes, Uranus is tilted on its side. This means that Uranus essentially rolls around the Sun, with its poles sometimes facing the Sun directly. Seasons: Due to this tilt,
                    Uranus experiences extreme seasonal variations. For about a quarter of its orbit, one pole is in continuous sunlight while the other is in continuous darkness, leading to extreme differences in temperature and lighting. Day Length:
                    Uranus rotates on its axis once every 17.2 Earth hours, meaning that one Uranian day is just under 18 hours. 4. Atmosphere and Weather: Calm Appearance: At first glance, Uranus appears relatively calm compared to other gas giants like
                    Jupiter and Saturn. However, it does experience dynamic weather patterns, especially at certain times of its orbit. Storms: Despite its seemingly placid surface, Uranus can exhibit storms and cloud bands. The Hubble Space Telescope
                    and ground-based telescopes have observed occasional storms in Uranus’s upper atmosphere. Methane Clouds: Uranus has methane clouds that can form at different altitudes. These clouds may be responsible for some of the bright spots
                    seen on Uranus from Earth. 5. Internal Structure: Ice-Rich Mantle: Beneath the atmosphere, Uranus has a thick layer of icy materials composed mainly of water, ammonia, and methane. These ices are not solid but rather exist in a superheated,
                    high-pressure form that behaves more like a fluid. Rocky Core: At its center, Uranus likely has a small, rocky core that is only a fraction of the planet’s total size. The core is surrounded by the icy mantle, and it is relatively
                    less massive compared to the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. 6. Moons: 27 Known Moons: Uranus has at least 27 moons, which are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five largest moons are
                    Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Miranda: Among Uranus's moons, Miranda is especially notable for its strange and varied surface. It has canyons, terraces, and other large features that suggest a history of intense geological
                    activity, which is unusual for such a small moon. Triton-like Moons: Some of Uranus’s moons, particularly Ariel and Titania, may have experienced tectonic and volcanic activity, with possible subsurface oceans. 7. Rings: Faint Ring
                    System: Uranus has a system of 13 faint rings. They are dark and narrow, composed mainly of icy and rocky debris. Uranus’s rings are less prominent and reflective than those of Saturn. Ring Arcs: The rings of Uranus are thought to
                    be relatively young and may be continuously replenished by material from Uranus's moons or collisions between small bodies orbiting the planet. 8. Discovery: First Planet Discovered with a Telescope: Uranus was the first planet discovered
                    using a telescope. It was found by Sir William Herschel on March 13, 1781. Herschel initially thought he had discovered a new comet, but it was later confirmed to be a new planet. Naming: Uranus is named after the ancient Greek god
                    of the sky, Uranus (the father of Saturn in mythology), following the tradition of naming planets after Roman and Greek deities. 9. Exploration: Voyager 2: Uranus has only been visited by one spacecraft: NASA’s Voyager 2, which flew
                    by the planet in 1986. Voyager 2 provided valuable data about Uranus’s atmosphere, rings, moons, and magnetic field. No other missions have visited Uranus since. Future Missions: There has been increasing interest in sending a dedicated
                    mission to Uranus in the future to further study its moons, rings, atmosphere, and interior, particularly given the planet’s unique characteristics. 10. Magnetic Field: Tilted Magnetic Field: Uranus has a highly unusual magnetic field
                    that is tilted by 59 degrees from its rotational axis and is offset from the planet’s center. This irregular magnetic field causes Uranus to have a complex and varying magnetosphere. Magnetic Poles: The magnetic poles of Uranus are
                    not aligned with the planet’s geographic poles, which leads to a highly irregular and chaotic magnetic environment. 11. Temperature: Cold Planet: Uranus is one of the coldest planets in the solar system, with temperatures dropping
                    to around -224°C (-371°F) in its upper atmosphere. Despite being farther from the Sun, Neptune is warmer due to internal heat, whereas Uranus does not seem to radiate much heat. Cold Interior: Unlike Neptune, Uranus does not appear
                    to have a significant internal heat source. This lack of internal heat makes Uranus colder than it otherwise would be. 12. Interesting Phenomena: Axial Tilt: Uranus’s extreme tilt is one of the biggest mysteries surrounding the planet.
                    It’s thought that Uranus was struck by a massive object early in its history, which knocked it over onto its side. This unique axial tilt gives Uranus its extreme seasons. Icy Composition: While Uranus is classified as an ice giant,
                    its "ices" (water, ammonia, and methane) are not the frozen kind we think of on Earth. Instead, these substances exist in high-pressure, supercritical states within the planet’s mantle. 13. Role in the Solar System: Outer Planet: Uranus
                    is one of the four outer planets and is important for understanding the dynamics of the solar system’s outer regions. It also helps scientists learn about planetary formation and the characteristics of ice giants. Kuiper Belt Influence:
                    While not directly part of the Kuiper Belt, Uranus’s gravitational influence extends into the distant reaches of the solar system, affecting objects in the outer regions. 14. Potential for Future Exploration: Uranus is considered a
                    priority target for future missions due to its unique characteristics, including its extreme axial tilt, faint rings, and dynamic moons. A mission to Uranus could provide insights into the formation of ice giants, a class of planets
                    that may be common in other star systems.</p>
