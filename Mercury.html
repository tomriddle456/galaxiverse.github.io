                <p class="t-e">1. Orbit and Rotation: Closest to the Sun: Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles). Short Year: It takes only 88 Earth days for Mercury to complete one orbit around the Sun, making
                    it the planet with the shortest year. Slow Rotation: A day on Mercury (one full rotation) lasts about 59 Earth days. Interestingly, this means that one Mercury day lasts about 176 Earth days because of its unusual 3:2 spin-orbit resonance
                    (Mercury rotates three times for every two orbits around the Sun). 2. Extreme Temperatures: Daytime Heat: Because it is so close to the Sun and has no significant atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury experiences extremely high temperatures
                    during the day, reaching up to 430°C (800°F). Frigid Nights: Without an atmosphere to hold in the heat, nighttime temperatures drop drastically to around -180°C (-290°F). 3. Surface and Composition: Craters and Plains: Mercury's surface
                    is heavily cratered, much like Earth's Moon, and it also has smooth plains formed by ancient volcanic activity. The planet's lack of tectonic activity keeps its surface largely unchanged. Iron Core: Mercury has a large metallic core,
                    making up about 85% of its radius, which is much larger in proportion to its size than Earth's core. This core is thought to be composed mainly of iron. Magnetic Field: Despite its small size, Mercury has a weak magnetic field, about
                    1% as strong as Earth’s, which indicates that the planet’s core may still be partially molten. 4. No Atmosphere: Mercury has only a very thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. This exosphere is composed
                    mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. This lack of a substantial atmosphere also explains the planet's extreme temperature variations. 5. Lack of Moons: Mercury does not have any moons or rings, likely due to its
                    proximity to the Sun and small size. 6. Exploration: The planet has been visited by two spacecraft: Mariner 10 (in the 1970s) and MESSENGER (2004–2015), which provided much of what we know about Mercury today. A new mission, BepiColombo,
                    launched in 2018, is a joint European and Japanese mission set to reach Mercury in 2025 to gather more data. 7. Tidal Locking: Due to its 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, Mercury has a peculiar rotational pattern where its solar day (from
                    sunrise to sunrise) is much longer than its orbital period. 8. Possibility of Ice: Surprisingly, scientists believe that there may be water ice in permanently shadowed craters at Mercury’s poles, where temperatures never rise above
                    freezing. 9. Size and Gravity: Smallest Planet: Mercury has a diameter of about 4,880 km (3,032 miles), making it slightly larger than Earth’s Moon. Low Gravity: Its surface gravity is about 38% of Earth's, meaning you'd weigh less
                    on Mercury than on Earth.</p>
