                <p>1. Size and Structure: Largest Planet: Jupiter has a diameter of about 143,000 km (88,846 miles), making it more than 11 times wider than Earth. It is so massive that it could fit all the other planets inside it. Gas Giant: Jupiter is
                    primarily made of hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (around 10%), similar to the composition of the Sun. It lacks a solid surface, though it may have a small, rocky core deep beneath its thick atmosphere. Massive Gravity: Jupiter's gravity
                    is the strongest of any planet in the solar system, being 2.5 times that of Earth’s. 2. Orbit and Rotation: Long Year: Jupiter orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 778 million km (484 million miles), taking about 12 Earth
                    years to complete one orbit. Fast Rotation: Despite its massive size, Jupiter rotates extremely quickly, completing one full rotation (one day) in just about 10 Earth hours. This fast rotation causes the planet to bulge at the equator.
                    3. Atmosphere and Weather: Thick Atmosphere: Jupiter’s atmosphere is made primarily of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases like methane, ammonia, and water vapor. Great Red Spot: One of Jupiter's most iconic features is
                    the Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries. It is a high-pressure region with winds reaching speeds of up to 432 km/h (268 mph). Banded Appearance: The planet is known for its colorful bands
                    of clouds, made of ammonia ice and other compounds. These bands are driven by powerful jet streams moving in opposite directions at different latitudes. Extreme Storms: Jupiter experiences violent weather, including massive storms
                    and lightning strikes much more powerful than those on Earth. 4. Moons and Rings: Many Moons: Jupiter has at least 92 known moons. Four of these, known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), are especially noteworthy.
                    Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even larger than Mercury. Europa: Europa is particularly interesting to scientists because of its potential subsurface ocean, which may harbor life. Io: Io is the most volcanically
                    active body in the solar system. Faint Rings: Jupiter also has a faint ring system, composed mostly of dust particles, but they are much less prominent than Saturn's rings. 5. Magnetic Field: Strong Magnetosphere: Jupiter has the most
                    powerful magnetic field of any planet, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. This enormous magnetosphere extends far into space, trapping charged particles and creating intense radiation belts. Auroras: Jupiter’s magnetic field
                    also produces stunning auroras around its poles, much stronger than those seen on Earth. 6. No Solid Surface: As a gas giant, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The atmosphere gradually transitions into a superheated liquid
                    hydrogen interior as you go deeper, eventually reaching a core that may be composed of rock, metal, and hydrogen at extremely high pressures and temperatures. 7. Jupiter’s Role in the Solar System: Gravity Shield: Due to its immense
                    gravity, Jupiter plays a crucial role in protecting the inner solar system by deflecting comets and asteroids. Some theorize that it acts as a shield for Earth by capturing or redirecting potential impactors. Formation Influence: Jupiter's
                    large mass may have significantly influenced the formation of the solar system by preventing the coalescence of material into another planet between it and Mars, which is why we have the asteroid belt. 8. Space Exploration: Jupiter
                    has been studied by several spacecraft, including Pioneer 10, Voyager 1 and 2, and Galileo. The Juno spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in 2016, is currently studying the planet’s atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure
                    in greater detail than ever before. 9. Internal Heat: Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun. This is due to the slow contraction of the planet, a process called Kelvin-Helmholtz heating, which causes gravitational energy
                    to convert into heat. 10. Strong Radiation Belts: Jupiter’s powerful magnetic field traps particles that form intense radiation belts around the planet. These radiation belts are dangerous for spacecraft and future exploration missions.</p>
